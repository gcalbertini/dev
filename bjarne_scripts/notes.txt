abstract class: a class that can only be used as a base class and uses pure virtual functions in order to do so
No objects of an abstract class can be created (except for base subobjects of a class derived from it) and no non-static 
data members whose type is an abstract class can be declared. Pointers and references to an abstract class can be declared.
=========================
virtual function: specifies that a non-static member function is virtual and supports 
dynamic dispatch, i.e., can be redefined in derived class *if needed* (override optional)
========================
pure virtual method:  virtual returnType foo() = 0; or virtual returnType g() override = 0 so
*required* to be implemented by a derived class if the derived class is not abstract.
=========================
concrete class: opposite of ABC and can create a class; can be derived from ABC
=========================
protected members: prevents us from making objects of this type directly; accessible in the class that defines them and in classes that inherit from that class
=========================
private members: only accessible within the class defining them
=========================
friends of their derived classes: both protected and private are available to these classes they are friends to (can be a global function or member function of another class)
friend return_type function_name (arguments);    // for a global function
            or
friend return_type class_name::function_name (arguments);    // for a member function of another class
========================
constructor: is a special non-static member function of a class that is used to initialize objects of its class type
========================
destructor: is a special member function that is called when the lifetime of an object ends. 
The purpose of the destructor is to free the resources that the object may have acquired during its lifetime. 
========================
delete keyword prevente copy constructor and copy assignment.
obj(const obj&) = delete // prevents copying
obj& operator=(const obj&) = delete // prevents assignment
========================
operator overload: T& operator=(const T& other) for copy assignment for example
========================
inheritance:  inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon another object 
(prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance), 
retaining similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes) 
from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a 
hierarchy of classes. In most class-based object-oriented languages like C++, an object 
created through inheritance, a "child object", acquires all the properties and behaviors
 of the "parent object", with the exception of: constructors, destructors, overloaded 
 operators and friend functions of the base class.
==========================
general polymorphism: concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface.
==========================
Run-time polymorphism/dynamic dispatch/run-time dispatch/late binding: function called is determined at run-time based on object used (for virtual function methods)
==========================
Compile-time/static dispatch/polymorphism: for operator overloading and function overloading where signatures are changed but functions have the same name 
==========================
encapsulation: keeping implementation details of our classes private to protect them from direct use that could complicate maintenance
thus prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object; encourages decoupling
==========================
vtable: how most C++ implementations do polymorphism. For each concrete implementation of a class,
there is a table of function pointers ( _vptr is the hidden pointer) to all the virtual methods. A pointer to this table 
(called the virtual table) exists as a data member in all the objects. When one calls a virtual 
method, we lookup the object's v-table and call the appropriate derived class method.
==========================
template: mechanism which allows a programmer to use types as paramters for a class or a function. 
the compiler then generates a specific class or function when we provide specific types as arguments 
==========================
metaprogramming: writing code that writes more code for you at compile-time like using templates.
With these techniques, you can do things like compute factorials or construct complicated dynamic types that present high level data, 
all without any run-time overhead 
==========================
static cast: compile time; does things like implicit conversions between types 
(such as int to float, or pointer to void*), and it can also call explicit conversion functions.
even if you think you can somehow typecast a particular object pointer into another but it’s illegal, 
the static_cast will not allow you to do this; to use static_cast in case of inheritance, the base class must be accessible, 
non virtual and unambiguous. static_cast operator allows casting from any pointer type to void pointer and vice versa.
static_cast <dest_type> (source);
===========================
dynamic cast: In C++, dynamic casting is mainly used for safe 
downcasting at run time. To work on dynamic_cast there must be one virtual function in the base 
class. A dynamic_cast works only polymorphic base class because it uses this information to 
decide safe downcasting. Casting a base class pointer (or reference) to a derived class pointer 
(or reference) is known as downcasting. Casting a derived class pointer (or reference) to a base class pointer 
(or reference) is known as upcasting. Now, If the cast fails and new_type is a pointer type, it returns a null 
pointer of that type.
============================
reinterpret cast: It is used to convert a pointer of some data type into a pointer of another data type, even if the data types before and after conversion are different.
t does not check if the pointer type and data pointed by the pointer is same or not. It doesn’t have any return type. It simply converts the pointer type.
============================
============================
STL containers
===========================
vector: contiguously allocated sequence of elements; use as default container
list: doubly-linked list; used when need to insert and delete elem without moving existing ones
deque: mix of list and vector; don't use until have expert knowledge of algos and machine arch
map: a balanced ordered tree; use when needing to access elements by value
multimap: balanced ordered tree where there can be multiple copies of a key
unordered_map: a hash table; optimized version of map used for large maps when you need high perf and can create a good hash function
unordered_multimap: as above but multiple copies of a key
set: balanced ordered tree; use when need to keep track of individual values
multiset: as above but multiple keys 
unordered_set: like unordered_map but just with values not (k,v) pairs
unordered_multiset: like unordered_multimap, but just with values not (k,v) pairs
array: fixed size array that doesnt suffer most problems as built-in variants
============================
DATA STRUCTURES
============================
ARRAY 
Values contiguous in RAM. As long as we know index order of elements, can insert and remove in O(1) best case
To insert/remove into middle O(n) as need to shift elements overhead
==============================
LINKED LIST 
Values are not contiguous in RAM but connected by pointers. To insert/remove from the end O(1) as we have nullptr at ends
To insert into middle, assuming you know address, can detach and reaatach pointers for O(1), else O(n) to count from beginning to where you want to be
==============================
HASH MAP 
Instead of a key, have an index [0, n-1] not necessarily evenly (NOT ORDERED) spaced or ints (can have chars), 
then map each to some value with a hash function.
Can insert and remove in O(1) as we just find the key and drop or just add to the pile as is unordered.
Searching for key also O(1) 
==================================
QUEUE 
A doubly-linked-list. Push/pop from either front or back is O(1). Typically push elements to the back and pop from the front. 
===========================
BINARY TREE 
Typically a tree map where each node has a key value mapped to true value of node. For every child node 
spawned to the left of the parent node, value is less than that of parent's. For child nodes spawned to the right,
we get nodes with higher values. 
For a balanced tree: insert/remove/search all done in O(log n) time. What makes it balanced? 
For each level, the height of the left subtree is the same as the right one, 
so every root at that level has either two nodes or one node. 
Values are ordered so if you DFS, can get ordered list of elements. 
For unbalanced tree: built from sorted data is effectively the same as a linked list as elem increase so O(n) search worst case
=============================
Trie/Prefix tree
Each node usually represents a single character and has up to 26 children, one of each chars in alpha
To insert "ANT" having A->N connection, then just need additional T node. Insert/search then O(n)
Helpful when you know the prefixes to words
====================
HEAP
Usually min/max heap where min/max value will be the root of the tree and the children will always be greater/lesser. 
Every level of tree will be full except for maybe last level. While visualized as trees Typically
implement as arrays under the hood: [x|3|6|8|9] to get left 2*i and to get right 2*i+1 for index i
To get min/max value then O(1) as its parent node. To pop min/max value thne O(logN) also for insertion
======================
GRAPH
Nodes with edges that connect them together. Can be directed (edges have directions) or not to establish paths. Can be 
represented by adjacency list (Node-Neighbors list) when very dense 

==================
==================
A hashmap (or unordered_map in C++ terminology) is a data structure that maps keys to values. 

A hashmap typically consists of an array (or a table) of buckets, and each bucket may contain a linked list or
 another data structure to handle collisions. Here are the main components:
    1. Array of Buckets: The hashmap has an array of buckets, and the size of this array is usually
        determined based on the expected number of elements and the desired level of performance.
    2. Bucket: Each element in the array is a bucket, and it serves as a container for key-value pairs. The bucket may contain
        a linked list, a binary search tree, or another structure to handle multiple key-value pairs that hash to the same index (collisions).
    3. Key-Value Pairs: Each key-value pair represents the data stored in the hashmap. The key is used to calculate the hash code, which is then
        used to determine the index (bucket) where the key-value pair should be stored.
    4. Hash Function: A hash function is used to convert a key into an index within the array of buckets. The goal of a good 
        hash function is to distribute keys evenly across the array, reducing the likelihood of collisions.
+-------------------------------------+
| Array of Buckets                    |
+-------------------------------------+
| Bucket 0                            |
|   |-> (Key1, Value1)                |
|   |-> (Key2, Value2)                |
|   |-> ...                           |
| Bucket 1                            |
|   |-> (Key3, Value3)                |
|   |-> ...                           |
| ...                                 |
| Bucket N                            |
|   |-> ...                           |
+-------------------------------------+

When you want to insert or retrieve a key-value pair, the hashmap calculates the hash code of the key, 
maps it to an index in the array, and then searches or inserts the key-value pair in the corresponding bucket.

It's important to note that modern hashmaps often include optimizations, such as dynamically resizing the array
 to maintain a balance between load factor and performance. The load factor is the ratio of the number of stored 
 elements to the number of buckets, and keeping it within a certain range helps to prevent performance 
 degradation due to collisions.
=============================
==============================
A process and a thread are both fundamental concepts in operating systems and concurrent programming, but they serve
 different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here are the key differences between a process and a thread:

    Definition:
        Process: A process can be viewed as an independent program in execution. It has its own memory space, resources, and state. 
        Processes are typically isolated from each other and communicate through inter-process communication mechanisms.

        Thread: A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Threads share the same memory space and resources, 
        such as file handles, with other threads in the same process. Multiple threads within a process can run concurrently.

    Memory Space:
        Process: Each process has its own address space, which includes code, data, and system resources. 
        Processes are isolated from each other, and communication between processes usually involves inter-process communication mechanisms.

        Thread: Threads within the same process share the same address space. This means they can directly communicate with each other through 
        shared variables and can access the same data structures.

    Resource Overhead:
        Process: Processes have higher resource overhead compared to threads because each process has its own memory space, 
        file descriptors, and other resources.

        Thread: Threads have lower resource overhead since they share resources with other threads in the same process.

    Communication:
        Process: Inter-process communication mechanisms, such as message passing or shared files, are used for communication between processes.
        Thread: Threads within the same process can communicate more easily through shared memory since they have access to the same data structures.

    Creation and Termination:
        Process: Processes are typically heavier to create and terminate. Creating a new process involves duplicating the existing process, 
        including its memory space.

        Thread: Threads are lighter weight and quicker to create and terminate compared to processes.

    Independence:
        Process: Processes are independent of each other, and the failure of one process does not directly affect others.

        Thread: Threads within the same process are more interdependent. If one thread crashes or encounters an error, 
        it can potentially affect the entire process.

In summary, a process is an independent program with its own memory space, while a thread is a 
unit of execution within a process that shares the same memory space with other threads in that process. 
Processes are more isolated, have higher resource overhead, and communicate through inter-process communication mechanisms, 
while threads share resources and communicate more easily through shared memory.

Purpose:

    HashMap: A hashmap (or unordered_map in C++, for example) is designed to store key-value pairs, where each key is unique. 
    It uses a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, allowing for efficient insertion, retrieval, and deletion of key-value pairs.

    Set: A set is a collection of unique elements, and it only stores values without associated keys. The primary goal of a set is to provide a
     way to check for the presence or absence of an element in the collection.

Structure:

    HashMap: A hashmap is typically implemented as an array of buckets, and each bucket can contain a linked list, a binary search tree, 
    or another structure to handle collisions (multiple keys hashing to the same index).

    Set: A set is commonly implemented as a hashmap where only keys are used (with a dummy value, for example) or as a specialized data 
    structure optimized for efficient membership testing, such as a balanced tree.

Key Characteristics:

    HashMap: Requires both a key and a value. The key is used for indexing and the value represents the associated data.

    Set: Only contains the elements (values), and it is concerned with checking for the presence or absence of these elements.

Usage:

    HashMap: Used when you need to associate a value with each key, and you want efficient key-based lookups. 
    Useful for scenarios where you need to store and retrieve data based on some identifier.

    Set: Used when you only need to maintain a unique collection of elements and do not need to associate any additional 
    information (values) with those elements.

std::unordered_map<int, std::string> myHashMap;
myHashMap[1] = "One";
myHashMap[2] = "Two";
myHashMap[3] = "Three";

std::unordered_set<int> mySet;
mySet.insert(1);
mySet.insert(2);
mySet.insert(3);

In summary, a hashmap is a key-value store, while a set is focused on maintaining a unique collection 
of elements without associated values. Hashmaps can be used to implement sets,
 but the choice between them depends on whether you need to associate additional data (values) with your keys 
 or if you simply want to manage a collection of unique elements.

===============
References and pointers are both used in C++ to indirectly access variables, but they have some key differences:

Reference: Once a reference is declared, it must always refer to the same object. 
The syntax for declaring a reference is simpler than that of a pointer.

int x = 10;
int& ref = x;  // Declaration and initialization of a reference

Pointer: A pointer can be re-assigned to point to different objects during its lifetime.
 The syntax for declaring a pointer involves the use of an asterisk.

    int x = 10;
    int* ptr = &x; // Declaration and initialization of a pointer

Nullability:

    Reference: Cannot be null. It must always refer to a valid object.

    Pointer: Can be assigned a null value (nullptr in modern C++ or NULL in older versions). This allows pointers to represent the absence of an object.

Memory Management:

    Reference: Once a reference is bound to an object, it cannot be rebound to refer to a different object. 
    References don't need to be explicitly deallocated, and there is no "null reference."

    Pointer: Pointers can be reassigned to point to different objects, and memory allocated using pointers needs to be explicitly 
    deallocated to avoid memory leaks.

Indirection (Dereferencing):

    Reference: No explicit dereferencing is needed. Accessing a reference is similar to accessing the actual object.

int x = 10;
int& ref = x;
int value = ref; // No explicit dereferencing

Pointer: Requires explicit dereferencing using the asterisk (*) operator to access the value pointed to by the pointer.

        int x = 10;
        int* ptr = &x;
        int value = *ptr; // Explicit dereferencing

    Reassignment:
        Reference: Cannot be reassigned to refer to a different object once initialized.

        Pointer: Can be reassigned to point to different objects during its lifetime.

    Size:
        Reference: Typically takes up the same amount of memory as the type it refers to. No separate memory is allocated for a reference.

        Pointer: Requires additional memory to store the memory address it points to.

In summary, references provide a simpler syntax, are non-nullable, and have automatic dereferencing, 
while pointers offer greater flexibility with reassignment, nullability, and explicit dereferencing. 
The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of your program.
